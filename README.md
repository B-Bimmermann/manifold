A Parallel Simulation Framework For Multicore Systems


**Installation Instructions**

If you are on Ubuntu (>= 14.04), just run setup.sh script in the root directory 
after QSim is installed. This will link the manifold to the QSim library specifi
ed by $QSIM_PREFIX variable, download multi-thread benchmarks supported by manif
